Changes for 2.1.0
=================
- Added the coberturaReport task to generate coverage reports. (issue 20)

- The cobertura task now depends on tasks of type test in the applying project,
  and tasks named test in child projects (but not all tasks of type test in the
  child project).  It no longer runs tests in parent projects, sibling projects
  or tests in child projects that are not named "test". (issue 14)

- The coverageSourceDirs extension property now looks for scala and groovy code
  by default. (issues 7 and 22)

- Instrumentation now happens only when source code has changed or the cobertura
  configuration has changed. (issue 23)

- Instrumentation now depends on the classes task so that changes to Groovy
  or Scala source code triggers re-instrumentation. (issue 15)

- The plugin adjusts dependencies for test tasks added after the plugin is
  applied (issue 21)

Changes for 2.0.0
=================
- Updated the plugin to work with Gradle 1.7.  Dropped support for prior
  versions of Gradle.

Changes for 1.2.0
=================
- Added support for Cobertura 2.0 and its extra configuration options.

- Fixed bug that caused the configuration of test tasks to fail on sub-projects
  that don't have the coberura plugin applied. (issue 8)
