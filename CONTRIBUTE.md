This is still a work in progress. If anyone would like to help out, here are a few things I'm still trying to accomplish.

This plugin needs some robust unit tests. The testclient directory has a little java project that I use to manually test different scenarios, but we could really use some proper unit tests.

Did I mention testing? :-) As issues are resolved, it would great if I could have unit tests that made sure that things fixed for prior issues are still fixed. This is becoming more important as I do more work with multi project builds and multi language projects.
